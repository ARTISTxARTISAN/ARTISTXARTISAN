## Hi there from the ARTISTxARTISAN TEAM ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**ARTISTxARTISAN/ARTISTXARTISAN** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on GitHub.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ We currently working on ARTISTxARTISAN Chrome Extension

- ðŸŒ± We looking forward to implementing this into [i]nternational [t]erritory 

- ðŸ‘¯ We are currently collaborating with Generative Neural Networks

- ðŸ¤” We are looking for help from GNNs | RNNs | LNNs

- ðŸ’¬ Ask us about HOW TO PIMP (Productively, Improve, Modes, Proficiency) thru GNNs | RNNs | LNNs

- ðŸ“« How to reach us: Pull A Request or through Devpost as ARTISTxARTISAN

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: JORDY|it|xx
               it for GNNs
               TEAM | it STAGE
               
- âš¡ Fun fact: JORDY | It's hard for me to cry. I usually laugh things off as a way to cope with stress. Sometimes ppl may thing that I am making fun of them or lying. Which can make me laugh more too. ðŸ˜… GNNs are funny sometimes too.
